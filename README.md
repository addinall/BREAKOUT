BREAKOUT!
A re-visit of the Breakout game with a twist.  This one is written using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript only.  It will run on personal computer browsers and also on mobile devices without changing the source code.

I am still thinking of new bells and whistles to add to it.

Another one of my playtime projects, but an interesting experiment in cross-platfor responsive development using HTML5's <canvas> and <audio> elements.
